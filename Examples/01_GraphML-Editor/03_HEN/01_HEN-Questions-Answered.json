The typical workflow order is: requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.\n\nCreate or import graph (using JSON or GraphML)\n2. Add or edit nodes and edges\n3. Save and load graph progress\n4. Export graph in GraphML format for sharing\n5. Visualize graph data (if visualization feature is implemented)\n6. Interact with the graph visualization (if interactive feature is implemented)\n7. Export graph visualization as an image (if visualization feature is implemented)",
