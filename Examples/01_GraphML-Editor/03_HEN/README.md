## Additional Research into Software Engineering Techniques, Tactics, Procedures

### Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBoK) [^0][^1]
From Chat GPT:

Here are some additional strategies and approaches to software development, along with detailed examples and sources:

1. **Divide and conquer**: This strategy involves breaking a complex problem into smaller subproblems and solving them individually. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to form the solution to the original problem. 

    Example: QuickSort algorithm. The algorithm selects a 'pivot' element, then partitions the array into two smaller arrays â€“ one with elements less than the pivot and one with elements greater than the pivot. The algorithm is then recursively applied to the two smaller arrays. [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/)

2. **Stepwise refinement**: This approach involves breaking a problem down into a series of smaller problems or steps, then incrementally refining each step until the desired solution is achieved. 

    Example: Building a web application. Start by defining the high-level components (UI, backend, database), then refine each component by detailing its subcomponents and their interactions. Continue refining until you have a complete, detailed design. [Source](https://www.slideshare.net/AdewaleOshineye/stepwise-refinement)

3. **Top-down vs. bottom-up strategies**: Top-down strategies begin with a high-level view of the problem and work downwards, refining the solution at each level. Bottom-up strategies, on the other hand, start by building smaller components and combining them to form the overall solution.

    Example: Building a compiler. In a top-down approach, you would start by defining the high-level architecture (lexer, parser, code generator), then work on implementing each component. In a bottom-up approach, you would first implement smaller components (e.g., specific parsing rules) and then integrate them to form the complete compiler. [Source](https://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node1.html)

4. **Heuristics**: Heuristic strategies use simple, practical techniques to find approximate solutions to complex problems. These solutions may not be optimal, but they can be found quickly and are often sufficient for practical purposes.

    Example: The A* search algorithm is a heuristic pathfinding algorithm used in AI and game development. It estimates the cost of reaching the goal from the current state and uses this information to guide the search, reducing the time it takes to find a solution. [Source](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)

5. **Patterns and pattern languages**: Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. A pattern language is a collection of patterns that, when used together, can help guide the design process.

    Example: The Gang of Four's Design Patterns book describes 23 design patterns, such as the Singleton, Observer, and Strategy patterns, which can be applied to various software design problems. [Source](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)

6. **Iterative and incremental approach**: This approach involves developing software in small increments, with each increment adding new functionality or improving existing features. The process is iterative, with feedback from users and stakeholders guiding the development of future increments.

    Example: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), advocate for an iterative and incremental approach to software development. These methodologies emphasize short development cycles, continuous integration, and regular feedback from stakeholders. [Source](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/agile-development)

These examples represent just a few of the many strategies and approaches available for software development. By understanding and applying these techniques, you can improve the quality and maintainability of your software projects.

### Stepwise Refinement (Wirth, 1971)[^2]
Gries points out [^3]: 

> We use the term here mainly to describe the development of a method from its specification. We will see small steps, like breaking a high-level statement into a sequence of statements, introducing a local variable, translating an English statement into Java, and introducing a method.

And [^4]:

> "The Raven" is a famous poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe also wrote an essay titled "The "Philosophy of Composition", in which he describes how he developed "The Raven". It is pure top-down design / stepwise refinement!
