Important, Not Urgent
=====================
- Clicking New Object will ADD an object
  - It WILL clear out the object form, but it SHOULD NEVER add objects
- The new zoom/click features can cause the window to get stuck
  - (e.g. the "scroll doldrums" -- you can move and zoom the graph, but NOT move up/down the page)
